# the_big_bang_gym

This is an applictication for the staff og a gym to add new customer, gym classes and schedule/book classes for customers. 

In order to access the app you need to follow the steps below:

Fork/clone the file from github.

Create a database on your computer inide the file (terminal:
     python_project git:(main)  psql -d python_project -f db/python_project.sql
     
Create the database -   create db python_project

Install Flask/PIP/psychopg

Database calls Python_project

Postgress(SQL) - download if necessary

On terminal type:
     run flask
     
On a browser go to
     http://localhost:5000
     
The app is very simple, you have a home page with a briedf message and you have threw other pages where you can see the members/customers, the gym classes and the bookings.
The idea is to be only one or two clicks away from any functionality your staff would like to access or check.
